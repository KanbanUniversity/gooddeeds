# How to Manage Your Good Deeds

Good Deeds are categorized into an approximation of expected total "burden" on an AKC. Burden currently is considered to have 2 axis, Duration and Effort. 

Examples of this are:

- Blog post (low effort / low duration)
- Creation of a Case Study (moderate effort / long duration)
- Attend a KLR - Money spent, short duration (high effort / short duration)

The burden categories we've decided to start with are simply described as:

- small (low effort, low to medium duration)
- medium (moderate effort, low to long duration)
- large (high effort, any duration)
- extraordinary (> high effort, > long duration)

## Small Good Deeds 

Small Good Deeds are expected to represent something that would take less than 1 day of work by an AKC and would be expected to span a week of lead time. Examples of this would include:

- Blog post
- LinkedIn Article
- Being a panelist for an AKC application

## Medium Good Deeds

Medium Good Deeds are expected to represent something that would take less than 3 days of work by an AKC and may span multiple weeks or months in lead time. Examples of these would include:

- Webinar preparations and delivery
- Presentation at a Meetup
- Creation of a Case Study (not including actual work being studied)

## Large Good Deeds

Large Good Deeds are expected to have a large burden on an AKC (greater than 5 days of effort invested or equivalent cost incurred by the AKC) over any sort of duration. Examples of these include:

- Attending a Kanban Leadership Retreat
- Significant contribution to the Kanban University Body of Knowledge
- Mentoring a future AKC candidate
- Participating on a KU Community Working Group

## Extraordinary Good Deeds

Extraordinary Good Deeds are expected to have a very large effort investment for a duration exceeding 3 months. Examples of this would be:

- Organizing and Running a Kanban-specific Meetup with > 6 meetings per year
- Attending and Presenting at a Kanban-specific conference

## Tracking Good Deeds
The Good Deeds Program manages Good Deeds in [KanbanZone.io](https://kanbanzone.io/b/qUCyZIwA). If you do not have access, please [contact the Good Deeds program](contact.md)

### Create your own Good Deed

Once you have access to the Kanban Board, you should be able to create and manage a card that represents your good deed. It is your responsiblity to create the card with a meaningful description and overview, and then self-assess the expected burden. This burden may be reviewed with you by the good deeds program working group. Once the Good Deed is complete, you would be expected to move the card to the Done column.

### Find a Good Deed
If you are not certain of what Good Deed you might do, you may also find Good Deed Options queue at the start of the Kanban board. In this queue, you will find un-assigned options that have been created by Kanban University or its working groups as something that would be seen as beneficial to the community. 

### Collaborate with another AKC on a Good Deed
You may also see a Good Deed that is in progress with another AKC that you'd be interested in collaborating on. Collaboration on a Good Deed would count towards both AKCs totals for the year.

## Reporting

At the end of each calendar year, the Good Deeds Working Group will produce throughput reports of each AKCs contributions via Good Deeds and pass that information on to the AKC Community Manager for review.
